This directory contains source for various documents that
relate to debugging packet flow to/from SR-IOV guests
using VFs managed by VFd.

Documents are compiled into PDF, and markdown output. The
markdown output is placed into the VFd wiki:

	1) clone the wiki 
		git clone https://github.com/att/vfd.wiki.git

	2) switch to the vfd.wiki directory

	3) copy in the updated markdown file, or add a new
		one if it wasn't a part of the wiki

	4) commit and push the changes


The document name in the wiki repo should be of the form
Foo-Bar-Is-Good.md  where the dashes (-) will be replaced
on the wiki table of contents making an easily read title.
